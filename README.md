Data Detective AI: Forensic Data Analysis System
Data Detective AI is a specialized analytical tool designed to transform complex datasets into actionable forensic insights. By leveraging the Gemma 3 Large Language Model (LLM), the system enables users to perform natural language querying against CSV data structures to identify patterns, anomalies, and critical data points.

Technical Core Competencies
Advanced LLM Integration: Utilizes Google’s Gemma 3 via Ollama for high-context data interpretation.

Forensic-Level Analysis: Engineered for deep-dive exploration of data records and evidence files.

Reactive Frontend Architecture: Built with Streamlit to provide a high-performance, interactive user interface.

Automated Data Processing: Implementation of Python and Pandas for robust data manipulation and automated reporting.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.x

AI Engine: Google Gemma 3 (Ollama Framework)

Web Framework: Streamlit

Data Science Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

Version Control: Git / GitHub

System Architecture
app.py: The primary application logic and LLM orchestration engine.

requirements.txt: Comprehensive dependency mapping for environment replication.

.gitignore: Configured to maintain repository integrity by excluding local virtual environments and sensitive artifacts.
